### jf_api_response.py

Used to check API response of JellyFin server. Read the docs here at https://api.jellyfin.org/ if you are diving into this rabbithole. Don't be like me, read the docs.

#

### yt_thumb.py

Scrape thumbnails from YouTube of all videos in the specified directory. The filename should have the IDs in square brackets
`filename [video_id].ext` for the script to work. The `yt_thumb.sh` does the same thing.
