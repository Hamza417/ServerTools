A set of personal server tools and scripts I wrote to make my self-hosting easily manageable.

This repo may contain python scripts, cron job ideas/setups and some commands that I use
frequently or often to do things on my server or automate something.


## Webpage
I have also created a homepage hosted on my homeserver.

You can visit the [homepage here](https://cloud417.space/), but it's not optimized enough 
for mobile devices yet so a PC is recommended for viewing it. I don't know much webdev
so only skimmed through the basics and made it in a few hours. Also since it's homeserver 
so it may be down most of the time.
